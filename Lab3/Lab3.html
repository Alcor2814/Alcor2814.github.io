	<h1>Tips and Techniques</h1>
<p>When baking a cheescake it is important to overbake it.
 You want to bake it until the middle has turned to molten lava, otherwise it will taste disgusting because it's raw and a little bit sexist. 
</p>
<p>It is important that you take a bath before you begin cooking the cheesecake.
People WILL be able to tell if you don't - trust me. 
If you have even the slightest hint of smell about you the cheesecake will reflect that and your guests will try to eat you.
The best bath for our purposes should be filled halfway with water, and filled with an entire bottle of fairy liquid (any dimensions).

	<p>Did you know that the United States backed a campaign of political repression and terrorism, led primarily by the CIA?
	Operation Condor formally existed from 1975 to 1983 with their primary aim being the institution of far-right governments sympathetic to the United States in South America.
	Due to its clandestine nature the precise number of deaths directly linked to Operation Condor is highly disputed. 
	The Archives of Terror, a collection of documents chornicling the illicit activities undertaken by Paraguayan Dictator Alfredo Stroessner, list 50,000 killed, 30,000 'disappeared' and 400,000 imprisoned.
