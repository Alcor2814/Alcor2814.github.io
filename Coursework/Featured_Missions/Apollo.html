			The Apollo missions were 17 missions which aimed to travel beyond low Earth orbit and to the Moon.<br>
			On July 20th, 1969 Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made history as the first humans to walk on the Moon.<br>
			The astronauts left behind an American flag, medallions honouring the crew of Apollo I, and a plaque saying "we came in peace for all mankind."<br>

		<div id = "Text2">
			The first Apollo mission to reach space was Apollo 7, a flight beset by its crewmembers developing head colds during the mission.<br>
			The first Apollo mission to reach the Moon was Apollo 8, the mission which brought back the iconic "Earthrise" photo.<br>
			Six of Apollo's eleven crewed missions landed on the surface of the Moon.<br>
		</div>
		<div id = "Text3">
			The Apollo missions revolutionised science with every experiment, such as proving the theory that a feather and hammer fall at the same speed in a vacuum.<br>
			The Apollo spacecraft served as the basis for the later Apollo-Soyuz docking mission and the Skylab space laboratory.<br>
			Each of the above missions served as a foundation for the International Space Station.<br>
