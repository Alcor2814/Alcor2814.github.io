		<div id = "Text1" style="margin-left:5%; margin-top: 1%;">
			The twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity landed on Mars in January of 2004.<br>
			Each rover lived well beyond their planned 90-day lifecycle, though Opportunity lasted as long as nearly 15 years of continuous operation.<br>
			Together they discovered evidence that Mars used to have liquid water, and was capable of sustaining microbial life for a time.<br>
		</div>
		<div id = "Text2"style="margin-left:5%; margin-top: 1%;">
			Spirit and Opportunity were preceded by Pathfinder in July of 1997 and followed by Curiosity in 2011.<br>
			Curiosity spent six years contemporaneous with Opportunity and currently coexists with Perseverance.<br>
			Curiosity was sent to discover more information about Mars environment and its potential past habitability.<br>
		</div>
		<div id = "Text3"style="margin-left:5%; margin-top: 1%;">
			Perseverance carried the Mars helicopter Ingenuity, a demonstration of powered flight on Mars, strapped to its belly.<br>
			Perseverance was sent to tests various theoretical landing techniques, scientific methods, and to study Mars' environment for potential future missions.<br>
			Perseverance has also been collecting core rock and soil samples which are intended to one day be retrieved for study!<br>
