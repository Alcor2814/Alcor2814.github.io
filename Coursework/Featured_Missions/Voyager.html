			The twin Voyager probes were initially designed for exploration of Jupiter and Saturn.<br>
			They made many discoveries on their journey, with Voyager 2 becoming the only spacecraft to explore Uranus and Neptune.<br>
			They have since reached Interstellar space in 2012 and 2018 respectively.<br>
		</div>
		<div id = "Text2">
			Pioneers 10 and 11 preceded Voyager in leaving the solar system but Voyager 1 has since passed Pioneer 10, becoming the most distant human-made object in space.<br>
			Both Voyagers carry "golden records", a 12-inch gold-plated copper disk which contains sound and images.<br>
			Each disk contains sounds and images selected to portray life on Earth, such as musical selections and spoken greetings in fifty-five languages.<br>

		<div id = "Text3">
			As of 2024 Voyager 1 is 163AU away from the sun, that's 163 times the distance of the Earth's orbit to the sun!<br>
			Voyager 2 is comparatively closer at 136AU from the sun.<br>
			Voyager 1 will see its 50th Anniversary on the 5th September 2028.<br>
