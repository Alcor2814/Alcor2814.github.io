					Third Rock From the Sun:<br>
						Earth is the largest of the terrestrial planets, planets composed primarily of rock or metal.<br>
						Earth sits at an average of 150 million kilometres from the sun, a distance which is the basis for the Astronomical Unit.<br>
						At a distance of one astronomical unit it takes eight minutes for light to travel from the sun to the Earth.<br>
						Earth also has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees causing a yearly cycle of seasons affected by solar heating.

					Life:<br>
						Earth is the only planet known to have life in possibly the entire universe.<br>
						Most of Earth is covered in liquid water, which provides a very convenient place for life to begin approximately 3.8 billion years ago.<br>
						Earth's mix of chemicals and temperature provide a good basis for life to develop, other planets with Earth-like qualities are typically contained in the "Goldilocks Zone" of habitability.<br>
						Earth also has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees causing a yearly cycle of seasons affected by solar heating.

					Planetary Shield:<br>
						Near to the surface Earth has an atmosphere consisting of 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, and 1% of trace other gases.<br>
						The atmosphere also protects the surface from meteoroids, many of which burn up in the atmosphere or at least reduce in size.<br>
						The planet's rapid rotation and molten nickel-iron core create a magnetic field.<br>
						The Magnetosphere has a variety of functions, such as pointing all compasses internal or otherwise North and shielding the planet from solar or cosmic radiation.

					Orbits:<br>
						The Earth completes a full orbit of the sun every 365.25 days, a fact which creates "leap days" every four years.<br>
						The Earth is the only planet in the solar system with only one moon.<br>
						The Earth has an extensive array of satellites and other spacecraft orbiting it, observing both the planet and its distant surroundings.
