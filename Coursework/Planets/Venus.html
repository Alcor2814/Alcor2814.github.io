					Second son of the Sun:<br>
						Venus completes an orbit of the sun in 225 Earth days, which is actually less time than a day on Venus.<br>
						A day on Venus is 243 Earth days long, and subject to temperatures as high as 475 degrees Celsius.<br>
						Venus and Uranus both rotate in the opposite direction to the other planets.

					Habitability:<br>
						Venus is a strong candidate for habitability in the solar system. 50 kilometres up from the surface temperatures range from 30 to 70 Celsius.<br>
						Venus' atmosphere is known to contain linkages of sulfur atoms which could provide microbes with a coating to protect them from sulfuric acid and ultraviolet light.<br>
						Russian Venera probes did detect particles in Venus' lower atmosphere approximately a micron in length, the same size as an Earth bacterium.

					Structure:<br>
						Structurally Earth and Venus are remarkably similar, each having an iron core surrounded by a hot rock mantle and a rocky crust.<br>
						Venus' surface is dotted with thousands of volcanoes and home to an extreme atmmisohere, mostly carbon dioxide based with clouds composed of sulfuric acid.<br>
						Of the Russian Venera probes the longest survivor lasted two hours in the incredibly corrosive atmosphere.

					Missions to Venus:<br>
						Venus was the site of many firsts in interplanetary missions in human history, including the first interplanetary mission ever.<br>
						The Soviets launched 16 Venera probes with varying aims and success. 
						Venus has been examined numerous times to identify its potential for life or habitability.
