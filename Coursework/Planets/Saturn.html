					Sixth from the Sun:<br>

						Saturn is also the farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, and is 9 times wider than Earth at 120,500 kilometres diameter.<br>
						Saturn was named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth.<br>
						Saturn has 146 officially recognised moons in orbit, with further awaiting official confirmation and official naming.

					Rings:<br>
						Saturn's rings are believed to be pieces of comets, asteroids, or shattered moons which were torn apart by Saturn's gravity.<br>
						Ring particles range from dust-sized icy graisn to chunks as big as a house, some even as large as a mountain.<br>
						Saturn's rings extend up to 282,000 kilometres from the planet though vertical height is usually only up to 10 metres.<br>
						There are three main rings with four more recently discovered fainter rings.

					Structure:<br>
						Saturn has an average density lower than water, meaning it could float in a container of water.<br>
						Winds in the upper atmosphere reach speeds of 500 metres per second.<br>
						Saturn's north-pole has a hexagon-shaped jet stream spanning about 30,000 kilometres forming a massive storm at its centre.

					Orbit:<br>
						Saturn sits at an average distance of 1.4 billion kilometres from the sun, or 9.5 astronomical units.
						Saturn makes a complete orbit of the sun in 29.4 Earth years.<br>
						A day on Saturn takes only 10.7 hours.<br>
						Saturn has a 26.73 degree tilt relative to its orbit, giving it seasons much like Earth.
