					Most Massive:<br>
						Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and more than twice as massive as all other planets in the solar system combined.<br>
						Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth at 69,911 kilometres radius.<br>
						Jupiter sits at an average distance of 778 million kilometres from the sun, 5.2 Astronomical Units.

					Classical History:<br>
						Jupiter was formally given its name in 1976, after the king of the Roman pantheon.<br>
						Both the ancient Greek and Roman civilisations named the planet after their king gods, Zeus and Jupiter.<br>
						Jupiter is believed to be the oldest planet in the solar system, forming one million years after the sun and 50 million before the Earth.

					Orbit:<br>
						Jupiter is home to four large moons and 91 recognised smaller moons, with Europa's oceans being a potential source of life!<br>
						Jupiter has rings composed of small, dark particles which were discovered by Voyager 1 in 1979.<br>
						Jupiter completes one orbit of the sun every 4,333 Earth days, its rotations are much faster with one day taking 10 hours.

					Atmosphere:<br>
						As a gas giant Jupiter is entirely atmosphere, as far as can be observed.<br>
						The specific structure of Jupiter is theoretical but it likely has three layers of ammonia ice, ammonium hydrosulfide crystals, and water ice and vapor.<br>
						Due to its lack of a surface Jupiter is rife with winds reaching as fast as 539 km/h and storms lasting as long as 300 years, like the Great Red Spot.<br>
