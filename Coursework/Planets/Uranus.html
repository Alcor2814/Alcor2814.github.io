					First with a telescope:<br>
						Uranus was discovered in 1781, the first planet to be discovered with the aid of a telescope.<br>
						Uranus rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from its plane of orbit, causing it to appear to spin sideways like a rolling ball.<br>
						Uranus' strange rotation gives it extreme seasons in which each half of the planet is subject to decades long summers and winters.<br>

					Orbit:<br>
						Uranus sits about 19 astronomical units, or 2.9 billion kilometres, away from the sun<br>
						At this distance it takes sunlight 2 hours and 40 minutes to travel to Uranus.<br>
						One day on Uranus takes about 17 hours, with each Uranian year completing in 84 Earth years.

					Rings and Moons:<br>
						Uranus has 28 known moons, unique for being named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope.<br>
						Uranus has two sets of rings, with nine rings in the inner system and two rings in the outer system.<br>
						Only one spacecraft has come near Uranus, Voyager 2. The next closest spacecraft was the Cassini spacecraft which visited Saturn.

					Structure:<br>
						Uranus is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system, the other being Neptune.<br>
						Near the core of the planet temperatures reach as high as 4,982 degrees celsius.<br>
						Uranus is the second least dense planet in the solar system as a result of being composed of a hot dense fluid of water, methane, and ammonia.
						Wind speeds can reach up to 900 kilometres per hour on Uranus, with winds at the equator flowing in the reverse of its rotation.
