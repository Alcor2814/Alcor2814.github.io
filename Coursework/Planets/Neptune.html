					Furthest from the Sun:<br>
						Neptune can travel so far away from the sun that the dwarf planet Pluto's orbit can be closer for a period of 20 years.<br>
						Neptune was named for the Roman god of the sea, due to its structure and colour.<br>
						Scientists believe there might be an ocean of super hot water under Neptune's clouds, kept from boiling away by incredibly high pressure.

					Orbit and Rotation:<br>
						One day on Neptune takes about 16 hours to complete.<br>
						Neptune makes a complete orbit around the sun every 165 Earth years, meaning it completed its first orbit since discovery in 2011.<br>
						Neptune rotates at an angle of 28 degrees, giving it similar seasons to Earth though across 40 year stretches.

					Moons and Rings:<br>
						Neptune has 16 known moons, with each moon being named for lesser sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.<br>
						Triton orbits Neptune in a direction opposite to Neptune's rotation, the only moon in the solar system to do so.<br>
						Triton's thin atmosphere has been observed to be mysteriously growing warmer despite a surface temperature of -235 degrees celsius.<br>
						Neptune has at least five main rings and four prominent ring arcs, named after astronomers who discovered Neptune and its moons.

					Structure:<br>
						Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium much like Uranus but exhibits a more vivid blue, suggesting an unknown component.<br>
						Neptune is composed of gas, water, and other melted ices.<br>
						Neptune's wind can be up to nine times stronger than Earth's, reaching speeds of up to 2,000 kilometres per hour.<br>
