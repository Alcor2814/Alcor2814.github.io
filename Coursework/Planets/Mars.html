					Life and Habitation:<br> 
						Scientists don't expect to find living things on Mars currently due to its lack of an atmosphere and cold temperature.<br>
						Instead, many missions are launched with the aim of discovering proof of life existing long ago or good conditions to support future life.<br>

					Missions:<br>
						Mars is subject to many missions as a result of its similarity to Earth and past potential for life.
						The purposes of missions vary from long term studies, like the rovers, to tests of equipment, to studies of Mars from orbit.
						NASA plans to extend the framework created by its Artemis missions to support missions to and colonisation of Mars.
