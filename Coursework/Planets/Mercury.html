					Tiny Rock:<br>
						Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's moon, making it the smallest planet in the solar system.
						Mercury orbits the sun at an average distance of 58 million kilometres, approximately 1/3 of an AU.
						Mercury has an eccentric, egg-shaped orbit taking it from a low of 47 million kilometres from the sun to a high of 70 million kilometres in a round trip of 88 days.
						At this distance it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury on average.

					Formation:<br>
						Mercury formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled gas and dust together until a planet formed.<br>
						Mercury is a terrestrial planet, indicated by its core, rocky mantle, and solid crust.
						Mercury is frequently bombarded by asteroids giving it its signature pockmarked surface.

					Atmosphere and Magnetosphere:<br>
						Mercury lacks an actual atmosphere, instead it possess a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by solar wind and meteroids.<br>
						The exosphere is comprised mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium.<br>
						Mercury's magnetosphere is 1% as strong as Earth's but can still produce magnetic tornadoes through interaction with solar wind.

					Surface:<br>
						Most of Mercury's surface appears greyish-brown to the human eye, with bright streaks called crater rays formed from asteroid/comet impacts.<br>
						Temperatures on mercury operate over an extreme range, from 430 degrees Celsius to -180 degrees Celsius across the course of its 59 Earth days rotation.
