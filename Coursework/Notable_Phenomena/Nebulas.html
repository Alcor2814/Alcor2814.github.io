			A nebula is a giant cloud of dust and gas, sometimes hundreds of lightyears in diamete.<br>
			Nebulae are often called stellar nurseries due to the fact their gas, dust, and other material will clump together and eventually form stars.<br>
			Nebulae also give rise to planets with the remaining material left over from stellar formation.<br>
		</div>
		<div id = "Text2">
			Though the first nebulae were observed as early as 964 they were not particularly studied until the 17th Century with advancements in telescopes.<br>
			In 1715 Edmond Halley, the astronomer Halley's Comet was named after, published a list of six nebulae which kicked off increased interest in discovering nebulae.<br>
			The supernova which formed the Crab Nebula  was observed by Arabic and Chinese Astronomers in 1054.<br>
		</div>
		<div id = "Text3">
			Nebulae typically form as a result of supernova explosions, massive explosions of material flung off from stars who have reached the end of their life cycles.<br>
			Some nebulae do form from gas that hasn't yet been claimed by a nebula clumping together.<br>
			Other nebulae may be formed by stars shedding material for various reasons.<br>
