			Stars are giant balls of hot gas, mostly composed of hydrogen and helium with small amounts of other elements.<br>
			Stars vary in scale, affecting their life cycle, luminosity, and the violence of their death.<br>
			All stars begin the same, with clumps of gas and matter gathering together due to gravity and heating up due to friction.<br>
		</div>
		<div id = "Text2">
			At first the majority of a protostar's energy comes from heat released by its initial collapse.<br>
			For the longest stretch of the star's life immense pressure and temperature will squeeze the hydrogen atoms together to form helium, a process called Nuclear Fusion.<br>
			Stars that are stably undergoing nuclear fusion are known as Main Sequence Stars, such as the Sun.<br>
		</div>
		<div id = "Text3">
			The violence of a star's death varies depending on the mass of the star.<br>
			A low-mass star will keep expanding until it becomes a sub-giant or giant star , with some giants becoming unstable over time and ejecting its atmosphere to form a nebula which leaves behind a slowly cooling white dwarf.<br>
			A high-mass star will continue to fuse its elements beyond carbon and into iron, buying itself increasingly less time until the star runs out of energy and collapses, releasing a supernova and leaving behind a neutron star or black hole.<br>
