			The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth several billion years ago.<br>
			The Moon gets its name from the fact that people didn't know other bodies themselves had natural satellites as well.<br>

			The Moon stays at an average of 384,400 kilometres away from the Earth and continues to move away from the Earth at a rate of 1 inch per year.<br>
			The Moon rotates at the same rate that it orbits the Earth, causing it to always face the Earth with the same hemisphere.<br>
