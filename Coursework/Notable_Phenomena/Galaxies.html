			Galaxies are vast collections of stars, planets, and clouds of gas and dust bound together by gravity.<br>
			Galaxies can span from trillions of stars at millions lightyears across to a few thousand stars spanning a few hundred lightyears.<br>
			The specific shape of galaxies vary, usually spirals or ellipticals though they can form very irregularly.<br>
		</div>
		<div id = "Text2">
			Most galaxies are between 10 and 13.6 billion years, though others are still forming with the youngest known galaxy forming approximately 500 million years ago.<br>
			Gravity makes galaxies further organise into groups known as clusters, which may themselves be arranged into superclusters which are not gravitationallly bound.<br>
			The Milky Way sits in a cluster known as the Local Group, itself a part of the Virgo Supercluster which is itself part of the Laniakea Supercluster.<br>
		</div>
		<div id = "Text3">
			The Milky Way is Earth's Galaxy, a spiral Galaxy spanning more than 100,000 light years.<br>
			It takes the solar system approximately 240 million years to orbit the Milky Way once.<br>
			The Milky Way is approximately 2.5 milion lightyears away from the Andromeda Galaxy.<br>
