			Comets are leftovers from the formation of the solar system, orbiting the sun at varying distances ever since.<br>
			Comets are composed of dust, rock, and ices and range from a few miles to tens of miles wide.<br>
			There are likely billions of comets in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud, though the number of known comets is only 3,910.<br>
		</div>
		<div id = "Text2">
			The most famous comet is Halley's comet, a comet with a short-period orbit.<br>
			Halley's Comet becomes visible from Earth every 75-76 years, the only short-period comet that can appear twice in a human lifetime.<br>
			In 1986 Halley's Comet was studied up close by 8 scientific spacecraft from around the Earth.<br>
		</div>
		<div id = "Text3">
			Comets develop their characteristic tails from gases and dust emmitted as they heat up on proximity to the Sun.<br>
			Short-period comets are comets which take less than 200 years to orbit the sun, they reside in the juiper belt of icy bodies beyond Neptune.<br>
			The Oort Cloud is home to long-period comets, which take as long as 30 million years to complete one trip!<br>
